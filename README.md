# DrRacket-LCARS
An LCARS theme for DrRacket

I haven't used DrRacket in a while, so this is just a dump of the info file. Next time I start using DrRacket, I'll update this repo if necessary. One flaw I noticed in particular, the parentheses highlighting may be too dim for some screens or lighting (see screenshot).
